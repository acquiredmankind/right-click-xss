RightClickXSS is an extension that adds an option to the right click menu to insert sample XSS payloads.

It is useful for security testers who find themselves testing input boxes randomly for possible XSS.

Note: this is not an automated testing tool, you simply click and insert the XSS payload. You still must manually submit the form and watch for XSS.
